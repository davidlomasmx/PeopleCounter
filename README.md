Use two or more cameras to detect people entering and leaving from a building.

Entered poeple are saved temporarily until they leave so we have a way to track them so same persons are not counted multiple times.

# Enter camera
1. New persons face detected.
2. Check if person is already inside(counted on previous frame) if not add count and save person

# Exit Camera
1. Person face detected.
2. Check if person is inside, if so remove count, remove person from inside list. If person not found inside then do nothing
